# cereal-data-analysis

Welcome to my Cereal Dataset Analysis project! ðŸ¥£ In this project, I explore the fascinating world of breakfast cereals using Python and various data visualization libraries. I've analyzed the nutritional content and ratings of 77 cereals from different manufacturers, uncovering interesting insights about the factors influencing their ratings. From histograms and box plots to correlation matrices, I've visualized the data in exciting ways to understand which features make a cereal stand out. Using machine learning models like Linear Regression, I've even tried predicting cereal ratings based on their attributes. Join me on this crunchy adventure as we dive deep into the world of breakfast cereals! ðŸš€
